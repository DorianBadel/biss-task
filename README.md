If you want to see the code and change things around feel free to follow these steps:

## Cloning the repository

Open your favourite git go and clone this repository using the link provided above this .readme on the right.
You can also open a terminal in the folder you want the project in and type:

```
  git clone https://github.com/DorianBadel/biss-task.git .
```

When that is done just type
```npm start```

In some cases you might get a message like:
> 'react-scripts' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

But don't worry, just type:
```npm install react-scripts --save```

That's it! You should have a new http://localhost:3000/ tab opened in your browser!
